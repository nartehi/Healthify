# Healthify
A web application to teach children about the 8 dimensions of health in an interactive way


## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this hackathon project stems from the pressing need to empower young individuals with the knowledge and skills to lead healthier, more fulfilling lives. We believe that by addressing the 8 dimensions of wellness in an engaging and educational manner, we can make a meaningful impact on the well-being of children, setting them on a path towards a brighter and more balanced future.

## What it does
Out website is an interactive and engaging platform for young individuals to learn about the importance of wellness. Our vision was to make a website that looks and feels fun to use while teaching the 8 dimensions of wellness. After signing up or continuing as a guest, users are able to begin their quest to Healthify themselves by selecting the first level of wellness, the body. It isn't until this book is completed and a quiz passed until they are able to unlock the next dimension.
